00:00:05 | Speaker A: Good morning, Ms. Jacob. Good morning. My name is Terry Seligman. I'm from the law firm of Richmond and Levine, P.C. we represent plaintiff, Moonlight Plaza Associates in this matter. Can you hear me okay? 
00:00:22 | Speaker B: Yes. 
00:00:24 | Speaker A: Okay, there's a little bit of a delay on your end. Just for the record. I just want to make you aware of that. But this is a newer platform, so if you have any technical issues accessing a document, reviewing a document, or if you have any issues at all, please don't hesitate to let me know and we'll just get that squared away, okay? 
00:00:48 | Speaker B: Okay. 
00:00:51 | Speaker A: All right, Ms. Jacob, returning to just my introductory spiel, I just have a list of general instructions I give to all deponents. First, I ask that you make your answers verbal. A nod or an uh huh usually suffices in normal conversation, but in a deposition, it's important that we have a clear record. So please verbalize your response. And especially with the delay, that's even more important. So if you need a break at any time, don't hesitate to ask. I just request that you finish the pending question before we do take a break. And again, if you have any technical issues, don't, please let me know. Are you under the influence of any medication which may impair your ability to testify today? 
00:01:49 | Speaker B: No. 
00:01:51 | Speaker A: Okay. Are you under the influence of any drugs or alcohol which may impair your ability to testify today? 
00:02:00 | Speaker B: No. 
00:02:01 | Speaker A: Is there any reason you may not be able to truthfully answer the questions in this deposition? 
00:02:09 | Speaker B: No. 
00:02:11 | Speaker A: Okay. I'm presenting a document for you. Excuse me. Could we have this marked as Cancun Farms one, please? Absolutely. Thank you. Can we pull up Cancun Farms one? Great. Ms. Jacob, do you see the document that's been marked as Cancun Farms one in front of you right now? 
00:02:48 | Speaker B: Yes. 
00:02:50 | Speaker A: Okay. Do you recognize this document? I do. Okay. And have you reviewed this document? 
00:02:58 | Speaker B: Yes. 
00:02:59 | Speaker A: And have you been designated by Cancun Farms as the deponent to discuss and testify regarding the topics on the interrogatory? 
00:03:11 | Speaker B: Yes. 
00:03:13 | Speaker A: Okay. And what is your present position with Cancun Farms? 
00:03:19 | Speaker B: I am a senior environmental project manager. 
00:03:23 | Speaker A: And what are your duties as a senior environmental Product Manager? 
00:03:29 | Speaker B: I oversee assessment and remediation work on sites that have open spills. 
00:03:36 | Speaker A: And when you say oversee, do you directly oversee the remediation of those sites? 
00:03:44 | Speaker B: No, we hire environmental consultants for the day to day activities. 
00:03:50 | Speaker A: And do you interface with those environmental consultants? 
00:03:56 | Speaker B: Yes, I do. 
00:03:58 | Speaker A: And do you revise documents provided to you by those environmental consultants? 
00:04:05 | Speaker C: Objection. You may answer. 
00:04:08 | Speaker B: I'm sorry, I missed the first Part of that. 
00:04:12 | Speaker A: So do you revise documents provided to you by. By those environmental consultants? 
00:04:19 | Speaker B: I review them. 
00:04:20 | Speaker A: Do you discuss those documents with the. 
00:04:24 | Speaker B: And I will make edits. 
00:04:25 | Speaker A: Sorry. I'm sorry. Could we please speak one at a time, please? Sorry. Do you discuss those documents with the environmental consultants? 
00:04:37 | Speaker B: Yes. 
00:04:40 | Speaker A: And do you give them direction on how they're to proceed at a particular site? 
00:04:48 | Speaker B: We discuss remedial scope and assessment. 
00:04:51 | Speaker A: Scope. 
00:04:52 | Speaker B: I do not tell them how to prepare the reports for submittal to the regulatory authorities. 
00:05:00 | Speaker A: Do you tell them the exact scope of their work? 
00:05:04 | Speaker C: Objection. Please answer. 
00:05:06 | Speaker B: No. They present it to me and we discuss it. 
00:05:11 | Speaker A: Okay, so if Cancun Farms were to adjust a scope provided by an environmental consultant with respect to remediation, what would Cancun's adjustment be based on? 
00:05:28 | Speaker B: It would be based on discussions with the consultant and the exact scope of work that would be completed as to its completeness. 
00:05:38 | Speaker A: Well, how. Does. How does Cancun Farms determine what's appropriate or what's an appropriate scope of work under the circumstances? 
00:05:50 | Speaker C: If you can answer that, Chris. 
00:05:53 | Speaker B: I review the site history and the current conditions of the property with the consultant, and we discuss it and determine our plan to achieve closure. 
00:06:04 | Speaker A: Show. By site history, do you mean historical environmental documents associated with the property? 
00:06:13 | Speaker B: I'm sorry, I missed the first part of that again. 
00:06:16 | Speaker C: The connection is a little rough here. 
00:06:20 | Speaker A: All right, so by site history, do you mean the historical environmental documents associated with the property? 
00:06:30 | Speaker B: If they're available. 
00:06:33 | Speaker A: Okay. And would you review any leases associated with the property in making that determination as to the scope of remediation? 
00:06:45 | Speaker B: No, I normally do not review leases. 
00:06:49 | Speaker A: Okay. Would an existing lease factor into the scope of remediation? 
00:06:57 | Speaker C: Aston answered. 
00:06:59 | Speaker B: I would say no, because I don't review the leases. I just work with my consultant to close the spills. 
00:07:06 | Speaker A: Okay, so closing the spills in accordance with state and local regulations for a no further action letter, would that be fair to say? 
00:07:17 | Speaker B: Yes. 
00:07:18 | Speaker A: Okay. Ms. Jacob, who do you report to at Cancun Farms? 
00:07:24 | Speaker B: I report to Martin Hilfinger. He's vice.

00:07:33 | Speaker B: He's the vice president of environmental.

Mr. Porter, could we have this marked as Cancun Farms 2, please? Yes, this will be Cancun Farms 2. Thank you. Ms. Jacob, I've just displayed a document that's been marked as Exhibit Cancun Farms ii. Do you see that document in front of you?

00:08:25 | Speaker B: Yes. 
00:08:27 | Speaker A: Okay, can I just direct your attention to page 6 of the PDF? You'll see a 6 of 7 in the bottom left hand corner of the document. 
00:08:43 | Speaker B: Okay. 
00:08:46 | Speaker A: Oh, I'm sorry. It's the bottom of page five. My apologies. So, interrogatory number four at the bottom of page five reads Identify all. That's a typo. Each and every employee, officer, agent or representative of Cancun.
